This Python script, "simpleperf.py"  is a command-line tool that allows users to test  the performance of network connections by operating in either server mode or client mode. it can be used to send and receive data between a server and clients, measure the data transfer rate and display the results in a readable format.

The script has several comand-line arguments that can be used to customize its behavior:

-s or --server: Enable server mode.
-b or --bind: IP address for server binding (default is 127.0.0.1).
-p or --port: Port number used by both server and client (default is 8080).
-f or --format: Output summary format (B, KB, MB) for server and client (default is MB).
-c or --client: Activate client mode.
-I or --serverip: IP address of the target server (default is 127.0.0.1).
-t or --time: Time duration for data transmission in seconds.
-n or --num: Amount of data to send (B, KB, MB).
-i or --interval: Interval for printing statistics (x seconds, x > 0).
-P or --connections: Number of parallel connections (default is 1).

When run in server mode the script listens for incoming connections from clients and processes the data received from each client. In client mode the script connects to the server and sends data to it, either for a specified amount of data or a specified duration. Smpileperf can also display interval statistics if the --interval argument is provided.

To run simpleperf execute it using Python3:

python3 simpleperf.py [arguments]

Replace [arguments] with the desired command-line arguments to customize the behavior of the script.
